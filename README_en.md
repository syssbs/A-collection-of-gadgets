This tool can modify the creation time, modification time, and access time of files and folders on Windows and Linux.

*⚠️On Linux, the touch command cannot directly modify the creation time of files and folders. The creation time (also known as the birth time or crtime) is usually read-only and cannot be modified by conventional commands.*

## Function Introduction

### Existing Functions

1. Support batch modification of the creation time, modification time, and access time of folders and files.
2. Support selecting folders and modifying the time of the folder and its contents together or only modifying the time of the folder's contents.

### Optimization Functions

- [x] Modifying the time of the folder only, not the time of its contents

- [ ] Supporting modification of the creation time on Linux environments.

## System Commands for Modifying File Times

### 1. Modifying the creation time of a file:

`$(Get-Item “file path”).creationtime=$(Get-Date “11/04/2019 20:42:23”)`

### 2. Modifying the last access time of a file:

`$(Get-Item “file path”).lastaccesstime=$(Get-Date “11/04/2019 20:42:23”)`

### 3. Modifying the last modification time of a file:

`$(Get-Item “file path”).lastwritetime=$(Get-Date “11/04/2019 20:42:23”)`
